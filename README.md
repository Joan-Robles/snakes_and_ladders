# Snakes and Ladders Simulation

This project simulates a Snakes and Ladders game with the ability to introduce cheating mechanics, analyze game outcomes, and visualize results using Matplotlib.

## Features

- **Board Initialization**: Set up a Snakes and Ladders board with predefined snake and ladder positions.
- **Game Simulation**: Run simulations of the game with or without cheating.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the board setup and game outcomes.
- **Analysis**: Analyze the number of throws required to win under different conditions.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install matplotlib numpy
```

## Usage
### Initialize the Board
Set up the board with snakes and ladders, then mark the starting position for the player.

### Simulate the Game
Run the game simulation, optionally enabling cheating to see its effect on game outcomes.

### Visualize the Board
Use Matplotlib to visualize the board, showing the positions of snakes, ladders, and player movements.

### Analyze Outcomes
Analyze the results of multiple game simulations to understand the impact of cheating and other variables.
